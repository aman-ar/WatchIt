Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch using Material Design.

The Project was done as part of the Android NanoDegree Program at **Udacity**.

With the app, you can:

 - Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
 - Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline

   screen with additional information such as:
    - original title
